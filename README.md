# Vancouver Metal Shows

I have rebuilt this app from previous versions that were using various methods (Core Data, SQLite) to store my data. I will continue to add functionality to the new app using Objective-C as needed. Currently I am pulling data from a locally stored jSON file instead of my mySQL database because I'm too cheap to renew my web hosting account. :P 
I have commented out the code for the latter method for now. 

The goal for this app is to function very similarly to BandsInTown. Perhaps even use their API eventually to get my data...hmm.
